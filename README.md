🔄 Transfer: Supports safe transfer of NFTs between accounts.

🖼 Metadata: Supports token metadata URI for external storage of attributes.

🔐 Ownership Management: Implements OpenZeppelin's Ownable contract for owner control.

🛠 Tech Stack

💻 Solidity: Smart contract language.

🔏 OpenZeppelin: Security-enhanced contract libraries.

⚡ Hardhat: Development and testing framework.

🌍 Ethereum/Polygon: Compatible blockchain networks.

📥 Installation
